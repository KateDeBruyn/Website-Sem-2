        <h1 class="heading-one">Defining and Understanding Interaction</h1>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Interaction in data visualisation has become an area of study in its
          own right that draws from the field of human-computer interaction
          (HCI). It is important to define and understand interaction as it
          plays a key role in visualisation design practices and enabled
          flexibility in visualisation design tools. Interaction is defined
          differently and mostly broad in both the visualisation research
          community and the HCI community. Furthermore, interaction's definition
          can be separated from interactivity, as well as interaction technique
          and the science of interaction (Dimara and Perin, 2020, p. 5) The two
          communities, visualisation research and HCI, are where Dimara and
          Perin draw their argument from in order to form an inclusive
          definition for what interaction can be understood as. In the
          interactive pie chart below are some summarising points to the
          concepts Dimara and Perin base their research on.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          The purpose of the pie chart is to demonstrate not only how broad the
          definition for interaction may be, but to highlight how various parts
          of the definition weigh differently depending on any given scenario.
          The ideas of interaction as a mediating entity, or human intent, as a
          dialogue, or as an amplification of cognition, are derived from the
          visualisation view. Whereas the HCI view sees interaction as a
          transmission of information, a cycle of communication, actions with a
          start, end and response, or a causal relationship. Both views include
          various definitions within themselves which is why I chose to
          represent this multi-faceted concept of interaction in a chart that
          shifts the weight of each definition. The shift in weight, enabled by
          the user's click of the button, represents how some definitions may be
          more applicable and appropriate than others depending on the kind of
          interaction one may be observing.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          In the visualisation research community, Dimara and Perin (2020, p. 6)
          found that overarching definition for interaction is “a dialogue
          between a human user and the visualization system over a central
          object of interest: the data”. There are also three approaches;
          system-, task-, and human-centric, that describe the concept of
          interaction within the field of visualisation. This is where
          interaction intends to amplify cognition during a person's exploration
          of data. It is important to note that the person, the user, is also
          “in control of the information space” (Dimara and Perin, 2020, p. 5).
          Some of the properties the community assigns interaction with include
          granularity (micro and macro actions), continuous interactions versus
          discrete, and degree of directness and indirectness. The issues that
          lie within the visualisation community's definition of interaction is
          that the terms used to describe interaction are rarely agreed upon.
          However, the authors do offer a compacted definition and describe
          interaction for visualisation as “the interplay between a person and a
          data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action
          from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such”
          (Dimara and Perin, 2020, p. 8).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          The HCI view includes seven concepts that systematise what the
          community believes as good interaction. These include dialogue (where
          the cycle of communication definition comes in), transmission,
          control, tool use, optimal behaviour, embodiment and experience.
          Dialogue involves the cycle of communitive actions; transmission sees
          the transmittal of information between users and computers; control
          defines interaction in systems consisted of goals, inputs and outputs,
          responses and states; tools refer to those that are used to enable
          action; behaviour sees interaction as an adaptive behaviour;
          embodiment relates to the action of being in the world and
          participation; and finally, experience defines interaction as
          phenomena shaped by a user's expectation, reaction and recall (Dimara
          and Perin 2020, p. 6).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Thus, it is clear to see some of the differences and the similarity
          between the HCI and visualisation research communities. Though the HCI
          community took the role of defining interaction earlier, it did so in
          the human-computer environment whereas the visualisation research
          community is a bit more niche. However, both offer a deep
          understanding of interaction, which is important to anyone who is in
          these environments - both HCI and Data Visualisation.
