            Data Visualisation, Data Art and Representation
          </h1>
          <h2 class="heading-two">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The fields of Art and Data Visualisation intersect with one another,
            and create a relationship, when an artwork is formed by using raw
            data, its information, and its data visualisation techniques. This
            essay will discuss the intricacies in these relationships and how
            the theories of representation are embedded in the process.
            Representation cannot be divorced from data visualisation and data
            art, because the two fields rely on representational theories to
            form themselves and give their form meaning. First, the relationship
            between data visualisation and art will be discussed, and then the
            discourse will move over to the role representation plays.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-two">Data Visualisation and Data Art</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Data Art can be termed and understood as “data-driven” art; art that
            uses and is based on raw data that has been converted into
            information through data visualisation techniques. Data art
            encapsulates the intersectional relationship between art and the
            science of data visualisation. Data-driven artwork, as opposed to
            broader art, can be identified by its “intent rather than surface
            aesthetics” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007, p. 3) because the
            artwork's intent is to represent the raw data and its information.
            To do this, the artwork may make use of data visualisation
            techniques which also show the conversion of raw data into
            information that a viewer can gain meaning from. Data art and data
            visualisation have an interdependent relationship with one another
            when it comes to finding ways to represent the data best.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            A more specific field of art can be used to examine this
            relationship further - Techno-Art. Sabine Roeser (2016, p. 127)
            coined this term and used it to describe “art that reflects on and
            engages with risky technologies”. An example of this could be the
            Last Clock data-driven artwork by Jussi Ängeslevä and Ross Cooper.
            Last Clock is made up of video footage warped into three concentric
            circles to form and represent a clock. The data used is digital
            video data; encoded digital images that render in rapid succession
            to form a video. This process of electronic representation, the
            video itself, could be argued as the data visualisation technique.
            Ängeslevä and Cooper used and based their artwork on this technique
            and technology. Firstly, the interdependent relationship can be
            identified in their use of a clock to represent video footage that
            renders a current recording of the camera's surroundings. Both the
            clock and the video recording constitute and symbolise time, and
            furthermore, the clock uses the current video recordings to
            symbolise time and the video uses the clock to record and render
            time passing. Secondly, while video recording may not be regarded as
            a risky technology that art needs to reflect on, for the sake of
            this aspect I introduce Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The Panopticon was designed by Bentham to illustrate systems of
            control and theories of self-surveillance. It is a circular prison
            comprised of cells that line the walls with a guard tower (or
            inspector's office) in the centre of the building. All the cells, a
            prisoner in each, can see and be observed by the middle office.
            However, they cannot see whether there is an inspector in the
            office. Bentham (1791) describes this as “the sentiment of a sort of
            invisible omnipresence.” Assuming they are always being watched, the
            prisoners become self-surveying of their behaviour and actions. Can
            we not liken this to public video cameras (like security cameras)
            that make us conscious of the other who may be watching? We are
            always able to see these cameras, and sometimes even told via
            signage, but we never see the inspector. Does this not then feel
            like a risky technology? Something capable of inducing scopophobia
            in the victim? In this regard, Last Clock can be seen as techno-art
            as it can offer a space for “ethical and political thinking… ethical
            reflection… [and] probe emotional-moral reflection” (Roeser, 2016,
            p. 128 - 129); which are intrinsic characteristics of techno-art.
            This Panopticon aspect of Last Clock also ties in representation to
            the relationship between data art and visualisation.

          <h3 class="heading-two">Strategies of Representation</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The discourse around panopticism, representation, data art and
            visualisation need to be guided by strong theories of
            representation. Michel Foucault examined Bentham's Panopticon and
            applied its theory to the representations of power. Before linking
            strategies of representation in data art and visualisation to power,
            representation itself needs to be defined.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Stuart Hall (1997, p. 16) defines representation as "the production
            of meaning through language". Language is a blanket term for any
            system of communication. Written text, imagery, or symbolism can be
            languages. The code used to program data visualisations and art is a
            language. Language aids the construction of meaning, with which
            representation is concerned (Kidd, 2015, p. 19). In the visual form
            of communication, where data visualisation and art can be found,
            language operates differently and sometimes disadvantageously.
            According to Kidd, visual communication can be “ambiguous,
            suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations” (2015, p. 26 - 27)
            because it is not underpinned by spoken language and is not always
            contextualised; its denotative and connotative meanings can differ
            to various viewers and often do. This particularly occurs in the
            case of Hall's constructivist approach. The constructivist approach
            posits representation as the “active labour of makings things mean”
            (Hall in Kidd 2015, p. 23). Everybody has a different way of doing
            this which is why art can spark various emotional responses and
            different discussions. While data visualisation practices aim to
            avoid anything vague, data-driven art uses data visualisation and
            representation strategies to invoke abstract feelings, opinions, and
            questions. Last Clock can be, and has been, analysed in this essay
            through the lens of data-driven art, visualisation, representation
            and even panopticism, but at the end of the day this is based on my
            own constructivist approach. Last Clock may have an entirely
            different meaning to another viewer as well as Ängeslevä and Cooper
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Data visualisation and data-driven art and their relationship engage
            with representational strategies like the constructivist approach.
            Data-art's active labour is in making raw data have meaning through
            data visualisation, artistic practice, and representation. But how
            does this labour relate to power? Does it? In the case of Last Clock
            and its panoptic quality, the answer is yes. Foucault describes the
            effect of the Panopticon as one that induces “in the inmate a state
            of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic
            functioning of power” (1975, p.3). The inmate is permanently
            subjected to the power the inspector holds through observation. Last
            Clock functions similarly to the Panopticon, in terms of constant
            surveillance, and is thus a powerful data-driven artwork. Ängeslevä
            and Cooper representational strategy, on the surface, was to use
            video footage and a clock. However, on a deeper level, their
            strategy is one of panoptic power as the representation of the video
            footage and ever-ticking clock implies the permanent surveillance.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-two">Conclusions</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            This is not to say that these are the only representational
            strategies out there that underpin the relationship between data
            visualisation and art. The example of the Last Clock is to deeply
            analyse what the relationship and representational strategies can
            mean. What artists can be capable of, accidently or intentionally,
            invoking in their viewers. Representation plays a role in the
            artist's decision making, not only in their question of how best to
            present the data they are using but also in their questions to “what
            does this mean?” and “how do the viewers make meaning?”. Analysing
            Last Clock is an example of this of itself. I am a viewer who used
            my previous knowledge, experiences, and opinions to formulate the
            meaning of Last Clock, whether they were close to the intentions of
            the artists or not.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Representation strategies and understanding them is at the forefront
            of analysing the relationship between data visualisation and
            data-driven art. Even strategies such as Gestalt Principles play a
            role in the creation of data-driven art, and thus play a role in its
            relationship to data visualisation. It may be wrong to not mention a
            representational strategy such as that because it is so intrinsic to
            design. And design is so intrinsic to art and data visualisation.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            In expressing an artistic intent or form, data-based creative
            practices synthesize and build upon techniques in communications and
            aesthetics.
