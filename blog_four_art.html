          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Data-driven art shows the intersection of science and art and there
            are many artists who use raw data to create their artworks. These
            works can be identified by their “intent rather than surface
            aesthetics” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007, p. 3) because the data
            used in the artwork still needs to represent and portray the
            important information one can extract from it. Viégas and Wattenberg
            (2007, p. 1) emphasise in their paper that artists “appropriate and
            repurpose “scientific” techniques” that call for visual analysis;
            where reasoning and contextualisation is encouraged through their
            choice of medium and subject matter. Data can be used in various
            ways to create artworks and artists tend to find and use mediums and
            techniques that fit or suit the data best. For example, Last Clock,
            by Jussi Ängeslevä & Ross Cooper is made up of sliced video footage
            warped into three concentric circles to form a clock. The outermost
            warped video plays in seconds, the middle in minutes, and the
            innermost in hours. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007, p. 8) note that
            this artwork and form of data visualisation creates a powerful and
            meaningful record of time and place as the clock “becomes a unique
            emblem of its surroundings.”
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-center"
            src="images/last_clock.png"
            alt="Last Clock image"
          />
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            When looking for data-driven artwork online, I came across the work
            of Giorgia Lupi, an information designer and the artist-in-residence
            for Art + Data. She has been noticed for challenging the “rigidness
            of data, designing approachable visual narratives that allow numbers
            to portray what they stand for: stories, people, and ideas” (Gordon,
            2021). In 2020, Lupi made a series of artworks that superimposed
            visualised and illustrated data over photographs of real life.
            Lupi's work stands out because of her use of graphs which my chosen
            visualisation technique for this website. Below is an example of how
            she uses photos from everyday life that can be used as tools for
            representing data.
          </p>
          <img
            height="700"
            width="700"
            class="img-center"
            src="images/Legislative by G Lupi.png"
            alt="Last Clock image"
          />
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            In this piece, Lupi uses windows to represent bills relating to
            legislative responses for policing. A single window represents a
            single bill. Lupi could easily superimpose data (visualised through
            a bar graph) on the image through the use of the windows as they
            allow for bars to be drawn across the buildings. This data-driven
            artwork relates best to my website, and inspired my data-driven
            artwork, because of its use of grid structures. The windows of each
            building are organised in a grid and even the buildings themselves
            are organised in the gridlines of the city. This encouraged me to
            think of everyday objects that also use grids in their composition
            that could be used to make my own data-driven artwork. Before I
            speak on my own artwork, here are some other pieces that Lupi
            created.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-center"
            src="images/Pollution levels.png"
            alt="Last Clock image"
          />
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Above shows air pollution levels trending downward due to people
            staying at home during lockdowns. Lupi's data was taken from “An
            Analysis of the Impact of the CoronaVirus Lockdown on our
            Environment” posted by Towards Data Science. Lupi superiposes
            visualised data about pollution over a photo of the sky, giving the
            artwork a focused intention and meaning. Below shows the percentages
            of people who took different actions against racial inequality. The
            data was taken from “Amid Protests, Majorities Across Racial and
            Ethnic Groups Express Support for the Black Lives Matter Movement”
            by Pew Research Center. Again, Lupi focuses the viewer's attention
            and understanding of the data by superimposing data about people
            over a photo of a group of people.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-center"
            src="images/Racial equality.png"
            alt="Last Clock image"
          />
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Lupi's depiction of data through her pieces of artwork share
            profound meaning and insight about the data the pieces represent.
            The photos she uses are related to the data to support the viewers
            understanding and contexualisation. Thus, choosing objects or
            capturing settings that relate to the data being represented can
            seriously impact how the viewers perceive the relationship between
            the data and the artwork, and subsequently, their ability to
            understand both.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The data I use is based off of games that are on sale and thus falls
            into the realm of gaming and related technology. For my data-driven
            artwork, I chose to represent some aspects of the data through a bar
            graph made out of a keyboard. Keyboards are used in PC gaming and
            hold deep connotative meaning in the digital realm. They imply a
            good or bad game, communication in lobbies, enable us to walk and
            run in game worlds. They also are unique in how they can be
            personalised ranging from colours or RBG light behaviours. They form
            part of the greater scheme of representing games. Because of their
            keys being organised in a grid like fashion, they also make for
            great bar graph enclosures.
          </p>
          <img
            class="img-center"
            src="images/Data Art A.png"
            alt="Last Clock image"
          />
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            This is a static and first iteration of my site's data-driven
            artwork, inspired by Lupi's use of real-life photos that create
            spaces for data to be visualised in. I not only used a keyboard for
            its grid-like structure, but also because of its use of text.
            Because keyboards contain letters, numbers or symbols on their keys,
            it allows for the appropriate text to accompany the data in an
            organic way. Much like how Lupi's use of the windowpanes of a
            building allow for bar graphs to be formed.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            To conclude, data-driven artwork shows us how science and art
            intersect with one another and how data visualisation lies at the
            forefront of this relationship. Chloe Gordon (2021) adds to our
            definition and understanding of data visualisation as she states it
            “is an interdisciplinary specialty that dissects facts and
            information and reformats it into digestible graphical
            representations”. Interdisciplinary is the key term that highlights
            the relationship between data science and data-driven artwork.
            Learning and using the best practices to work within the
            relationship will hopefully enable artists to create meaningful and
            impactful artwork that can contribute to society.
