          PLEASE NOTE: GitHub is not allowing my index page's resource to
          display properly. It first decided that
          src="../../src/js/navigation.js" was fine, but then it wasn't. Then
          src="../src/js/navigation.js" was fine and then it wasn't. Then
          src="src/js/navigation.js" was fine and then it wasn't. All three
          options worked and then didn't work, I can only assume its a GitHub
          issue. Everything works via Live Server. I hope you can please
          understand. You can click
          <a class="hyperlink" href="blogs/blog.html">here</a> to get to a
          working page. Or please scroll down to the bottom of this page and
          click on "UX and UX design" or "research" to navigate to another page
          with working navigation. Apologies for the inconvenience.

            <p>
              Welcome to a site created by Keightyrose dedicated to data
              visualisation, representation and art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data visualisation entails the act of visually representing types
              and forms of raw data to produce information that users can engage
              and interact with. This site bases not only its blogs,
              visualisation methods, and artwork, but its entire constuction too
              on research in the data visualisation field. For more information,
              see below.

          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Over the course of the year, we have been learning not only how to
            create our own unique websites, but about how these websites are
            developed with aesthetic and representational strategies in mind.
            This website in particular draws from academic readings, essays,
            papers and research on UI and UX design, Data Visualisation,
            Visualisation and Interaction research, and Data-Driven Art
            research. The website has been built off literature in these fields
            by authors such as
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books"
              >Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic</a
            >,
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02197062"
              >Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin</a
            >, and
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://www.interaliamag.org/author/martinfernanda/"
              >Fernanda B. Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg</a
            >
            to name a few. These authors feature across the website and have
            been extensively noted for their contributions to the making of this
            site. <br /><br />
            The aesthetic stategies used across the site have been formulated by
            the
            <a class="hyperlink" href="design/styleguide.html"
              >UX and UX design</a
            >
            and the necessary
            <a class="hyperlink" href="blogs/blog_two_UI.html">research</a>.
            Representation throughout the site involves the visualisation of
            data - the science and practice of visually representing data as
            consumable, understandable information This website makes use of
            types of bar graphs to represent gaming data and information. The
            aesthetics and representation strategies are also based around each
            other. For example, the site is structured in grids which mimic a
            similar construction to bar graphs. The aim of this was to use
            complementary aesthetic and representational strategies to bring you
            a cohesive and comprehensive website.
