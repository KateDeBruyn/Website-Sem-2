            <h2>Planning for Data-Driven Art</h2>
            <p>
              This is the initial plan for my artwork. I've used a keyboard
              because of how it's structure is able to offer a space for a bar
              graph. While designing, I had to figure out how to present the
              true percentages of each game's rating, so I divided the area of
              the keyboard I would use into 10ths. This was an area of 777px,
              each 10th being 77px. Doing it this made enabled me to represent
              the data accurately as well as get the right proportions and
              comparisons between each game. This data comes from the Steaming
              rating values given to each game in the API.

            <p>
              Here I used the number pad to represent the deal ratings given to
              each game too. Thus, viewers can see both the Steam rating of the
              game along with its deal rating. I used the same strategy applied
              for the Steam rating percentages and divided the area into 10ths.
              I added the numerical values at the top of each bar for clarity.

            <p>
              This will be the plan I will follow for a new and optimised Style
              Guide section. I will also probably rename it to "Design Section".
              This will be my plan for the exams, it will break up the
              wireframes by section via a sidebar so that the page is less
              cluttered and also decreases how much a user will have to scroll.
              Breaking up the wireframes into sections also makes the individual
              ones more impactful because they become the focal point as opposed
              to competing for views or real estate against others.

            <p>
              This was the initial rework planning I did for the data
              visualisation wireframe. I decided not to go with having the
              second graph's description to the left of it. This is because
              Western users (who are my general audience) read from left to
              right. I felt it may look cluttered to have descriptive text next
              to the y-axis' text.

              relating to Twitch streamers and a student's marks.

              I want this website to align with the colours of Twitch because
              I'm going to be using Twitch trends as my main set of data. I
              wanted to have similar colours while still having my own
              aesthetics come through on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              There seems like there is maybe a slight variation in colour on
              the index and style guid pages (when the laptop is unplugged),
              something I'm still trying to figure out too.
