          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            To analyse the User Interface and User Experience principles I have
            used to create this website, the terms should be defined. User
            Interface (UI) is a field in web design where design focuses on the
            controls a user will engage with when interacting with a website or
            app. User Experience (UX) is also a field in web design that focuses
            on the behaviour of the user and their feelings about the website or
            app (Ellis, 2018). Both these concepts deal with the frontend
            development of a website or application and is therefore client
            facing. Client facing side of software development requires design
            principles and practices to be considered to create the best
            interaction and experience. There are definitive principles that can
            be applied to the practice of UI and UX, which will be spoken about
            throughout this blog as they informed my site's design choices. I
            will begin with speaking about User Experience, then User Interface
            and then relate these design choices to the context of this
            website's focus on data visualisation.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Mariia Orlova (2016, p. 2) echoes Ellis' statement on User
            Experience and relates UX to the feeling a user may experience when
            interacting with a design. This experience comes from the entirety
            of the effect a user feels as a result of interacting with the
            website. Human psychology is a field that heavily influences and
            relates to design choices in UX. It shows how users may think, make
            decisions, and identify the ideas and aims of any site (Orlova,
            2016, p. 14). The functions of human factors in UX considers how
            people (users) see, read, memorise, think, pay attention to,
            motivate, socialise, feel, and make decisions and mistakes. For
            example, users “can only remember three or four things at the same
            time” (Orlova, 2016, p. 22), which is why my website groups
            important information into sections. The site has been designed to
            not let the user feel overwhelmed, or even underwhelmed, with the
            information available to be processed. For now, the index page
            includes an about, something I felt did not need to be on its own
            page, and a picture that relates to the ideas and aims of the site.

          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            UX involves practices and activities that help a designer achieve
            their user-centred design goals. These methods are progressive and
            iterative. Two that are common are the heuristic evaluation method
            and wireframing. Nielsen (in Orlova, 2016, p. 23) defines heuristic
            evaluation as “a usability engineering method for finding the
            usability problems in a user interface design so that they can be
            attended to as part of an iterative design process.” I can relate
            this to my peer review feedback that spoke about my colour choices.
            The user felt that the colour scheme does not accommodate for light
            and dark modes. This has inspired me to develop a function that will
            allow users to switch between light and dark modes on the site for
            to enable their preferred viewing experience.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Wireframing is used to visually represent the items and information
            of a page, including their hierarchy and organisation based on the
            needs of the user. The main blog page wireframe is an example of
            planning a page determined by how I may think the user is going to
            feel. The blog page will be populated with various different blogs -
            probably more than the user can remember at a time. To visually
            summarise and represent the content of each blog, the blurbs will be
            accompanied by an image. Below is the wireframe for this:
          </p>
          <figure class="figure-responsive">
            <img
              class="img-responsive"
              src="images/Wireframe_Main_Blog.jpg"
              alt="New wireframes and colour"
            />
          </figure>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I had to consider how I could plan this page so that all the
            different information is not overwhelming and confusing for the
            user. Using Gestalt principles (like similarity, enclosure, and
            proximity) each blog, in the exact same format, is slotted into a
            grid to form a cohesive and identifiable element.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Good UI considers and uses Gestalt principles too, along with other
            key principles like clarity, familiarity, user control, hierarchy,
            flexibility, and accessibility. When this site's index page is
            developed further, it will include a carousal that cycles important
            information that I want on the home page such as an about blurb and
            a background on who I am. You can see this plan in the index's
            wireframe:
          </p>
          <figure class="figure-responsive">
            <img
              class="img-responsive"
              src="images/Wireframe_Index.jpg"
              alt="New wireframes and colour"
            />
          </figure>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            According to Ellis (2018), UI “controls must be as responsive as
            possible, so the interface must be simple enough that interactivity
            is instantaneous.” Having a single carousal on the home page with
            only two buttons that indicate to the user they may move back and
            forth is a simple way to posit content effectively. Another way of
            implementing good UI is to use universally understood buttons such
            as the “hamburger” navigation menu.
          </p>
          <figure class="figure-responsive">
            <img
              class="img-responsive"
              src="images/Hamburger.png"
              alt="New wireframes and colour"
            />
          </figure>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Regular web users will recognise this symbol when it occurs on a
            site as it is a global standard. Using universally recognised
            iconography and concepts help users instantly identify what
            something does on the site.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            During the development of the website and through the assigned
            readings, I began to see how data visualisation design likens to UI
            and UX design. According to Knalfic (2015, p. 43) “graphs interact
            with our visual system, which is faster at processing information.”
            Graphs and tables can use or resemble grid like structures when
            being designed. This may indicate that our visual system connects
            with grid like structures quicker and with more ease than randomly
            designed and organised information. Using grids to organise
            information can create clarity and reduce cognitive load. It chunks
            actions and information and groups relative information together
            too. Users can process information visually and cognitively with
            ease when associative information is grouped in manageable portions.
            This strategy puts the user at the centre of design because it
            considers the best methods for users to engage with the content.
            Grid structures have been used across the web pages because
            “consistent design reduces friction for the user” (UXPin 2022, p.
            3). This design choice was done with simplicity and familiarity in
            mind. The pages make up the website as a whole and I wanted any page
            to be instantly identifiable to the user because of its similarity
            and relevance to other pages in the site.
