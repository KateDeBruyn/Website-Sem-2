            Data Visualisation and Digital Information
          </h1>
          <h2 class="heading-two">The Field of Data Visualisation</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            To comprehend the world around us we use various methods of
            representation that help produce forms of knowledge for us to learn,
            interpret and apply. One of these methods of representation involves
            the visualisation of data - the science and practice of visually
            representing data as consumable, understandable information. Though
            definitions of data visualisation may be various, somewhat
            subjective and come from different angles. It has been defined as
            transformative, computerised, information design; all with an
            emphasis on its ability to be read and understood. It has been
            explained as a method to “present features of data with basic
            element of graph from various dimensions and perspectives” (Cheong
            Chiek Hua et al., 2018). It has been defined as “a transformation of
            quantified data which is not visual into a visual representation”
            (Manovich in Li 2020). The perspective I come from is understanding
            data visualisation as the methods used to enable 'raw'
            incomprehensible data to become comprehensive and learned. Murray
            (2017, p. 1) echoes this perspective as they believe “raw data only
            becomes useful only when we apply methods of deriving insight from
            it.”
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Methodologies used to visually represent raw data involve the use of
            tables, charts, diagrams, graphs, simulations, waveforms, to name a
            few. These methods arise in two forms of the field: information and
            scientific visualisation. The design of information visualisation
            forefronts the communication of information whereas the scientific
            field focuses on using data to visualise phenomena (Li 2020).
            Information visualisation may use a graph to indicate previous waves
            of COVID19 infection rates over the last two years and scientific
            visualisation may simulate a heatmap of a country to indicate the
            transformation of hotspots during those waves. Both examples
            required quantifiable raw data to create a visual representation of
            what that data can mean and do. Data visualisation enables meaning
            to be derived from data.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Representing data visually comes with advantages, aspects and
            characteristics, and even supporting theories of perception, design
            and aesthetics. Advantages will be discussed at the end of this
            section because it opens the door to Data Visualisation and Web
            Development. According to Li (2020, pg 19), there are four aspects:
            real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual scalability and
            user assistance and personalisation. The first refers to real-time
            techniques that support the response of vast collections of data
            that are interacted with. Secondly, it requires quick and supporting
            'on-the-fly' visualisations. Scalability enables the vast and
            dynamic data sets to be added to and changed. And the user aspect of
            data visualisation speaks to the usability of the information -
            fields like UI and UX. Characteristics include readability,
            recognisability and meaning and they are “based on data
            communication for comprehension and knowledge acquisition” (Li 2020,
            p. 41). There are also two types of data. Primary and secondary data
            refer to types of data that are either collected directly from the
            source or extracted from already processed data - the first being
            primary and the second being secondary. It is important to
            understand the elements and angles that come with data visualisation
            so that we can make our visualisation techniques thorough,
            impactful, and meaningful.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            There are many advantages to data visualisation and understanding
            the relationship between data and information. Li (2020, p. 21) also
            echoes Author's quote when saying, “data itself has no value,
            significance or meaning until it has been processed into a form of
            information.” In short, data, primary or secondary, can be
            understood as unprocessed information and information can be
            understood as processed data. The advantage of the relationship is
            that information is what gives data a 'voice'. We can study and
            learn proper ways to organise, portray and represent information
            gathered from data. When we learn better ways to do so, our
            information becomes meaningful and purposeful, and our techniques
            take full advantage of what data visualisation has to offer. Data
            visualisation has the benefit of its ability to represent huge
            amounts of data immediately and concisely and patterns, analysis,
            hypothesise, and insights can be derived and gathered from it
            instantly. It bleeds into the fields of User Interface and User
            Experience as visualisation techniques, like tables and heatmaps,
            are intrinsically linked to how the user can interact with and
            comprehend the processed data. UI and UX are fields found in field
            of Digital Information, which is where this blog would like to turn
            its attention to. The advantages of data visualisation extend from
            the ones mentioned here, though if there is one advantage to be
            keenly aware of in this scenario, it is that data visualisation
            under the use and practise of computer-based technology and
            techniques generates digital information and knowledge from data.

            Data Visualisation and Digital Information
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            We are in the field (and era) of digital information and learning
            the best practices to represent information digitally is crucial to
            the role we play as knowledge producers. Representing information,
            in ways that include using data visualisation, is intrinsically
            linked to design metaphors. These metaphors are regarded as key
            elements, like concepts, terms, and images that represent data for a
            user to comprehend, consume, recall and command (Marcus, 1998, p.
            129). We can see that design metaphors and data visualisation have a
            very close relationship and similar nature. We may always find one
            in the other.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            To conclude, understanding what digital information entails helps us
            understand how we create, plan, code, and develop. In this case, we
            apply this to the websites we create. For example, if we used a
            graph to represent South Africa's COVID19 wave trends from 2020 to
            2022, we would have to apply principles from data visualisation and
            design metaphors. Both play a part in how that graph is created and
            portrayed. We would use our understanding of graphs, taken from data
            visualisation, to organise and process the data into information.
            Design metaphors could then be applied to create a graph that
            follows traditional 'conditions' that deem it a graph - such as it
            will use at least an x and y axis. This may seem obvious to us now
            because most of us know what a graph it - but we learned what a
            graph is and how to use it because of the fields of data
            visualisation and design metaphors and their practice. Thus, when we
            practice data visualisation and use design metaphors, we are aiming
            to create information that is as identifiable and readable and as
            common as something like the graph.
